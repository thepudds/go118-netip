## `net/netip` for Go < 1.18

This is an extraction of the `net/netip` package from Go 1.18's
standard library, for use in Go 1.17. 

Originally extracted by [@zx2c4](https://github.com/zx2c4) at [golang.zx2c4.com/go118/netip](https://golang.zx2c4.com/go118/netip).

When Go 1.18 is released, that repository will be deleted, so hence the copy here.

**NOTE**: This copy is being used for testing [thepudds/fzgen](https://github.com/thepudds/fzgen) and should not be relied upon more broadly.
